# JavaScript from Beginner to Professional - Learning Journey

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-from-beginner/9781800562523/">JavaScript from Beginner to Professional</a> by Laurence Lars Svekis, Maaike van Putten, and Codestars By Rob Percival.

## Book Description

This book demonstrates the capabilities of JavaScript for web application development by combining theoretical learning with code exercises and fun projects that you can challenge yourself with. The guiding principle of the book is to show how straightforward JavaScript techniques can be used to make web apps ranging from dynamic websites to simple browser-based games.

## Why Iâ€™m Sharing This

I recently completed a full-stack bootcamp and am continuing to build my foundational knowledge in JavaScript. Sharing solutions and documenting my journey through this book help illustrate my commitment to continuous learning and mastery of JavaScript. Regularly updating this repository motivates me to stay consistent with learning and practice. Additionally, by making my work public, I hope to add a few more small projects to my portfolio to showcase my abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, and within each chapter, you'll find my solutions to the exercises provided in the book.
